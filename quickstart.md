## [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender)

ZReviewTender is an open-source app store review bot I developed in August 2022. It automatically retrieves user reviews from the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store, forwarding them to a designated Slack channel.

Additionally, it allows you to set review fetching rules, integrate with Google Translate, Asana, Google Sheets, and supports custom operations.

## [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Github Action is a CI/CD automation integration tool provided by GitHub. You can use your own machines as servers (Github Runner) or utilize the machines provided by GitHub to execute CI/CD and automation scripts.

### Costs and Limitations
- Using your own machines (Github Runner):
[No special costs, only maximum execution numbers, concurrency limits, and some API short-term maximum request limits.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits)
- [Using GitHub-provided machines:](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*QyhxZ98B20NV18-W5vKJDg.png)

GitHub Free provides basic 500 MB storage (for CI/CD artifacts) and 2,000 minutes of execution time per month.

[**Note regarding machine costs:**](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers)
- If using GitHub's Windows machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 2.
- If using GitHub's macOS machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 10.

For detailed pricing calculations, please refer to the [official pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator?feature=actions).

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) **_Monthly minutes consumption: approximately 120 minutes_**

> _It only needs to run on basic billing Linux, with each execution taking about ‚â§ 1 minute. By default, it runs every 6 hours, spending 4 minutes a day, totaling approximately 120 minutes a month, which is well within the free quota._

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) **_Storage consumption: 0_**

> _No use of artifact storage, so there are no storage costs._

## [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Slack is the internal communication software used by the company. A Slack app will be created, and through this app's identity, the App Store review notifications will be forwarded to the designated channel.

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*HMMyU5jwY9iAMyiKmNgVJQ.png)

## [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) x [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) x [Slack](https://slack.com/)

> _We use Github Action to execute the ZReviewTender script and forward the results to Slack. The GitHub repository (Action) serves merely as a carrier, so even if your main project isn't hosted on GitHub, you can still easily complete the ZReviewTender deployment by following the steps below. üéâüéâüéâ_

> **_I have successfully deployed it across five different apps from various companies, and it has been running stably and for free for at least two years._**

### Advantages:
- **Free**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) is an open-source service I created, deployed on [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using the free quota, which is more than sufficient. You won't need to spend money every month on app review bots or similar services.
- **Secure**: The credentials and keys used to fetch reviews are securely stored in your GitHub private repository, ensuring that no one else has access to them. You won't have to risk leaking important credentials by uploading them to third-party services; [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) is an open-source project, and all operations can withstand public scrutiny.
- **Reliable**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender) uses the latest official API to fetch review information, making it more accurate, stable, and reliable compared to other services that previously fetched reviews via RSS.

[**If this project has helped you, feel free to sponsor me a cup of coffee. Thank you!**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli)

# Quick Start! üöÄ

> **_The entire setup process takes about 30 minutes, but it only needs to be set up once. Unless the credentials and keys change, it can run stably and for free forever._** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

## Step 1. Create a Slack App

If your organization already has a Slack app with `chat:write` or similar message-sending permissions, you can reuse it without creating a new one.

### [**Go to the Slack Apps homepage:**](https://api.slack.com/apps)

![](https://api.slack.com/apps)

Click "Create New App" in the upper right corner.

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*sFxmX9qty4UEgMhiTglEfA.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*XiqfLoEmITHyF9E-rDPjPQ.png)

1. Select: From scratch
2. Enter App Name: `ZReviewTender` or customize the Slack app name
3. Select the target Slack Workspace: Ensure you have permission to add a Slack app in the chosen workspace.
4. Create App

### **Add OAuth & Permissions Scopes:**
After creating the Slack app, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab to set up scopes.

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*VjXVtAkVN8PLtCAOHocAmA.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*WSNd89bJuG1xCIPM9SsLnA.png)

1. Select "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Scroll down to find the Scopes section
3. Sequentially add the three necessary scopes for the ZReviewTender Slack app:

```vbnet
chat:write
chat:write.public
links:write
```

### **Install App**
Return to the Install App tab to install the Slack app into the workspace.

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*qItvJK5tZ-i8vE5bNUZIKQ.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*Eevu3Sir68DhfFSrFKb1xg.png)

1. Select "Install App"
2. Click "Install to _YOUR_WORKSPACE_"
3. Click "Allow"

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*lj8KZ5bEOG9urPgtxet-YA.png)

After installation, return to the Install App page to find the `Slack App Bot User OAuth Token`. Click "Copy" to copy it, and **note it down for later use**.

### **Create a channel to receive review notifications:**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*vwILile0Y52PgjQAYLqGjQ.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*jZwuovjXaCbQiWTixOP5Dg.png)

- Sidebar -> Channels -> Create -> Create channel
- Name: Enter the desired channel name

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*cK8ihh9IQPacTjGKG4GS3Q.png)

**Visibility:**
- Public: Open to everyone, no further action needed.
- **Private: Private channel,** ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è **you need to add the newly created Slack app:**

#### **How to add Slack App to the channel:**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*AgCjAYb94XOmlIJ7VV6gaw.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*GVqrJlBg_9MjVyGitA2g-A.png)

1. Click on the top \#channel name
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Add an App"

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*KU5hdi2m46TUwZbjI-xKmg.png)

1. Search for the name of the Slack app you just created
2. Click "Add"

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*Qx2XPK8lspCrSauWE4IhXA.png)

A prompt will appear in the channel indicating success: `ZReviewTender joined.`

> **_‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è There is a known Slack bug here. The newly created Slack app might not appear in the search immediately; you may need to wait a while. You can use a public channel first, as public channels do not require adding the Slack app to function._**

### **Get Channel ID:**
The final and most important step is to get the Channel ID for later configuration.

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*CmQtV9QibdOb8zHuiYJS2Q.png)

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*VNmLOs0mBhF6qisDzx6Zcw.png)

1. Click on the top \#channel name
2. At the bottom of About, you will find the Channel ID information
3. **Note down the `Channel ID` for later configuration**

> **_Slack steps completed._**

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

### **Additional Information:**

**You can edit the Slack app name and icon in "Basic Information" -> "Display Information":**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*5THTrkeWXYa5QaGCNCmzhQ.png)

Remember to click "Save Changes" at the bottom right corner to save your changes.

**If there are new additions to OAuth & Permissions Scopes, you need to click "reinstall your app" to reinstall it for the changes to take effect:**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*pUdxf_G1uoHcq22VGjHOzw.png)

## Step 2. Generate Apple App Store Connect API & Google Play Android Developer API credentials
### Apple App Store Connect API credentials

**iOS is relatively easier; we only need to gather the following four pieces of information from App Store Connect:**

#### **Issuer ID:**

![](assets/0095528cf875/0*eHn-LMnUlS-04d70.png)

- App Store Connect -> Keys -> [App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api)
- **Note down the `Issuer ID` for later configuration**

#### **Private Key ID & Private Key:**

Click the "+" button to add:

![](assets/0095528cf875/0*MI0-cA0BTkq5XqkT.png)

- Name: `ZReviewTender`
- Access: `App Manager`

![](assets/0095528cf875/0*V0U2HjKTRfL8dl1j.png)

- `Key ID` **for later configuration**
- **Click "Download API Key" to save and download the "AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8" file for later configuration.**

#### **App ID: (The target App ID for fetching reviews)**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*zCgRRm0-nDwvcGOv26Aprw.png)

App ID can be found in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps) -> App Store -> General -> App Information -> `App ID`.
- **Note down the `App ID` for later configuration**

### Google Play Android Developer API credentials

Android is more complex, requiring you to first enable the API and create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Project associated with the app project, and then add the Service Account to Google Play Console and grant app permissions.

[**Go to Google Cloud Project:**](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)

Select the Google Cloud Project associated with the app project or create a new project.

#### **Enable "Android Developer API":**

![](assets/0095528cf875/1*zvWFDBuPRq9a6bizjqrx4Q.png)

## Other Settings
### Adding Filter Function

```yaml
    - FilterProcessor:
        class: "FilterProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        keywordsInclude: [] # keywords you want to filter out
        ratingsInclude: [] # ratings you want to filter out
        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```
- Simply add the `FilterProcessor` settings to the `processors` section of either `/config/apple.yml` or `/config/android.yml`.

### Adding Auto-Translation Function

Automatically translate reviews that are not in your preferred language using the Google Cloud Translation API (note that costs may apply).
- **Make sure that the GCP Project linked to the Service Account created in Step 2 has the "Cloud Translation API" enabled.**
- The settings for `apple.yml` and `android.yml` differ slightly.

`apple.yml:`
```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, which translates review text to your language. You can remove this entire block if you don't need it.
