2. make sure you have Bundle in your environment (I use `2.3.13`)
3. type `gem install ZReviewTender` in terminal

#### If you are **NOT** familiar with ruby:
1. MacOS comes with a System Ruby pre-installed, but we are **NOT** Recommend to use that, using rvm/rbenv's Ruby instead.
2. install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to manage Ruby environment
3. install Ruby through rbenv/rym (you can install ruby version `2.6.X`)
4. change the systme ruby to rbenv/rvm's Ruby
5. type `which ruby` in terminal to make sure current Ruby is **NOT** `/usr/bin/ruby`
6. type `gem install ZReviewTender` in terminal

### Manually
1. Clone this repo
2. Setup ruby environment
3. run `bundle install`
4. execute with `bundle exec bin/ZReviewTender`

# Configuration

If your don't need Google Translate Processor, you can remove it!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33706588/183294084-65b1fe12-f4c1-4713-94f9-512c87d41ebe.png)

just remove the Google Translate Processor code block, like above.

## Send Message to Slack Channel through Slack Bot or In-Comming WebHook?

Strongly Recommended **use Slack Bot** instead of In-Comming WebHook:
```
Please note, this is a legacy custom integration - an outdated way for teams to integrate with Slack.
These integrations lack newer features and they will be deprecated and possibly removed in the future.
We do not recommend their use.
Instead, we suggest that you check out their replacement: Slack apps.
```
message from [Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#posting_with_webhooks).

System will detect if you've specify slack bot token, than it's ignore In-Comming WebHook.

#### Usage

**Check Both Apple & Android App's latest Reviews**
```
bundle exec ruby bin/ZReviewTender -r
```

**Check Apple App's latest Reviews**
```
bundle exec ruby bin/ZReviewTender -a

**Check Apple App's latest Reviews [Specify Config YAML File Path]**
